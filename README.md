# Project1---HandDetection
Hand Detection for Safety in Machine Operation

bjective: Develop a vision system to detect and prevent accidents by identifying human hands
in proximity to critical machine parts.

1. System Architecture:
- Describe the overall architecture of the vision system, including hardware and software
components.
- Specify how the Nvidia Jetson Nano will be utilized in the system.
2. Image Processing and Hand Detection:
- Outline the steps for image preprocessing and feature extraction.
- Explain how Region of Interest (ROI) can be utilized to identify critical areas in the image.
- Propose an algorithm or method to accurately detect and track human hands in real-time.
3. AI Training and Development:
- Explain the data collection process and annotation methodology for training the hand
detection model.
- Discuss the AI training pipeline, including the selection of appropriate deep learning
frameworks and models.
- Outline the steps for training and fine-tuning the hand detection model using the collected
dataset.
4. Deployment Planning:
- Describe the deployment strategy for the vision system on the Nvidia Jetson Nano.
- Discuss any considerations or optimizations required for real-time performance.
- Address any challenges or limitations that may arise during the deployment process
